        <p class="text-lg leading-loose text-gray-500 lg:text-xl lg:leading-relaxed">Now that I am a UX designer, I notice that some designers tend to forget that wireframes are equally creative and technical. We are responsible for designing great ideas, but we are also responsible for creating product specifications. I admit that there can be so many details to remember that itâ€™s easy to lose track. To save time and energy for myself, I gatheindigo all of my years of wireframing knowledge into a single checklist that I refer to throughout the process. And now I am sharing this knowledge with you, so that you can get back to being creative.</p>
