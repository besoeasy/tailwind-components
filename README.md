# Tailwind CSS Components

Tailwind CSS Components are pre-built UI elements created using the Tailwind CSS framework. They provide ready-to-use design patterns like buttons, cards, forms, and more, simplifying web development. Developers can customize these components using Tailwind CSS classes or additional CSS styles. By leveraging these reusable building blocks, developers can create visually appealing and consistent user interfaces faster, promoting a cohesive design language throughout their projects.
